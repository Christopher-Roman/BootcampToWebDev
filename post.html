          <p>December 6th, 2018 is a day I will always remember. Something big was happening. It was graduation day. The previous twelve weeks didn’t hold a candle to the past seven days though. I averaged about two hours of sleep a night that week. I’d lay in bed, restless, working through bugs in my head, forcing myself not to grab my laptop and see if it would fix the bugs I had <del>created</del> found that day. Because that would have been like opening Pandora’s Box. </p>

          <p>Waking up that morning though. Going through my daily routine, you know the routine. I was as ready as I could be at that point. Full CRUD on five different related models. My PostreSQL database and my Python and Django Back End displayed through a React Front End using Semantic-UI-React and some basic CSS to create my capstone project. It wasn’t perfect, but it did exactly what I had coded it to do. I presented to the class and some of the General Assembly staff that came to watch, answered questions, and then it was over…</p>

          <p>Twelve weeks of intense focus on a single goal, graduation. Now it was over. But it wasn’t. I had just finished the warm-up. Now reality begins again. No more structured curriculum, no more set deadlines, no more instructors telling me what to create. It was up to me to do all of that now. I had to figure out what I wanted to continue learning, set my own deadlines (and hold myself accountable), and I had to figure out what I want to build. Oh, and I need to find a job.</p>

          <p>That last bit though, the finding a job thing… to acknowledge a quote from a once great man, I was not prepare. Or at least that is how I felt. If you thought imposter syndrome was rough during the course, it is so much more intense post graduation. So I tried to start by searching for junior developer jobs. "That’ll be a great place to begin" I reassured myself. A step above an intern, right? Wrong. Here are some requirement snippets from a large majority of the positions I have found in the Chicago Market.</p>

          <p>Junior Developer:</p>
          <li> 3 years of experience in systems analysis and application program development, or an equivalent combination of education and experience.</li>

          <p>Junior Java Developer:</p>
          <li>2+ years of experience writing with the Java technology stack with specific focus on the EJB, JTA, JPA.</li>

          <p>Junior Developer:</p>
          <li>At least 2 years of experience in coding</li>

          <p>Junior .NET/Mobile Developer:</p>
          <li>1-2 years of professional  experience in coding</li>
          <br>

          <h4>Need the job to get the experience, but you have to have experience to get the job. Tale as old as time...</h4>

          <p>While this is incredibly scary to look at with my measly twelve weeks of experience, I can't let it be a stop sign for me. And, it  shouldn’t be a stop sign for you.</p> 
          <p>In my past experience, I was responsible for hiring people. And, while most of the positions had at least some experience requirement, it wasn’t an end all be all hard "no" if they didn’t meet the criteria on the job description. If they got an interview with me, they had a chance. There is so much that cannot be taught. Personality traits that you can’t quantify in a job description. That is what I am currently holding on to. That is my light at the end of the tunnel. The spark that I keep burning. I haven’t had any real company interviews yet, but if I get the chance, you better believe I will show them why they should hire me.</p>
          <p>You will never get hired if you don't apply.</p>
          <blockquote class="blockquote">"You miss 100 percent of the shots you never take." -Wayne Gretsky</blockquote>
          <p>So get out there and start taking shots (You know what I mean...)! What's the worst that could happen? They say no?</p>

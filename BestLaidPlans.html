        	<h1>Best-Laid Plans</h1>
        	<span class="meta">Posted by <a href="https://github.com/Christopher-Roman" target="_blank">Chris Roman</a> on February 16, 2019</span>
	    	<p>So, as promised here is the calendar that I put together for myself.</p>

        <img src="img/Schedule-Pic.png">

        <p>I created a spreadsheet using Google Sheets that works pretty dynamically. You can get a copy <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1CrctUGe282Df4MsYC1Nxokn8JXX_nzHNTE5dgVQrjSo/edit#gid=0" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

        <p>There is a blurb on the spreadsheet explaining how to use it. If you have any questions or need help setting up the spreadsheet, please feel free to reach out. I'd be happy to walk you through it or even make the changes myself for you to make it easier.</p>

        <p>Okay, now, you might be asking yourself, "Hey, what made him decide to do the things that he have listed there?".  I’ll break down my thought process.</p>

	    	<h3>Projects</h3>

	    	<p>I need to rewrite my capstone project from my Bootcamp because we had some issues deploying on Heroku… because… Heroku….

        While this isn’t the most exciting thing to be working on, it is REALLY important to have this deployed and working and in my portfolio. I am also trying to look at this as an opportunity to not only practice, but also learn Firebase for deployment. And, Firebase leads me into my next focus.
        </p>

        <h3>Learn Swift</h3>

	    	<p>Swift is a language that Apple developed for iOS. The reasons I want to learn Swift are pretty straight forward. Apple holds an immense market share and mobile development is so hot right now! On top of that, Firebase is great for hosting apps (as long as everything configured properly…). With all of that said, I have an idea for a mobile game that I’d like to build.</p>

        <p>Also, a great resource to learn Swift can be found <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/course/developing-ios-10-apps-with-swift/id1198467120">here</a>.</p>

	    	<h3>Codewars</h3>

	    	<p>Something that always came up when we discussed outcomes during Bootcamp was having an online presence. Your GitHub tracks your activity, blogs track your activity, twitter tracks your activity and is an easy way to display what you’re working on/interested in, Linkedin and so many other things. But, Codewars is two fold. Codewars tracks your activity and gives you a score, it holds snippets of code you’ve written, and it gives you an opportunity to practice problems that you are more likely to face during interviews!</p>

        <h3>Job Search</h3>

	    	<p>This is pretty self-explanatory. </p>

        <h3>Final Thoughts</h3>

	    	<p>Now I have everything planned out. I have a list of things to do. I have GOALS! But, that is only one piece of this puzzle. The other piece is on me. I need to hold myself accountable to this schedule. I need to make sure that I follow it. I need to make sure that the hours I have listed are being worked. </p>

	    	<p>So, how do you do that? Talk to people. Talk to family. Talk to friends. Talk to that dude/lady at the coffee shop or library you go to, to work and be like, “Hey, you’re here as often as me. This is what I’m working on, if you think about it, ask me how it’s coming along. I’m trying to find ways to hold myself accountable.”</p>

	    	<p>I have already talked to my wife. I work regularly with a friend from bootcamp, and now I have you.</p>

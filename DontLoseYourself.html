        	<h1>Don't Lose Yourself</h1>
        	<span class="meta">Posted by <a href="https://github.com/Christopher-Roman" target="_blank">Chris Roman</a> on February 26, 2019</span>

          <p>So, before I went to Coding Bootcamp there was a long road that my wife and I had to traverse to set ourselves up financially to go down to one income while paying bootcamp tuition. We decided that the best way to accomplish this goal was to have me take a night management job at a new hotel to increase our income. The differential was nice and definitely made a big impact on how quickly we were able to reach our financial goals. But it also meant we were working opposite schedules.</p>

          <p>So, a year working as a night manager, three months of bootcamp, and now almost three months doing everything I can to find a job. </p>

          <p>A year and a half, eighteen months, seventy-seven weeks, five hundred and thirty-nine days.</p>

          <p>We have been relentlessly focused on this goal the entire time. But, what about us? What about our individuality? Our hobbies? The things we did before we switched gears to achieve this goal. Everything fell by the wayside. I used to write, a lot. I was working on the second draft of my first novel and I was working on the first draft of my second novel. I used to draw, write and illustrate comic strips with my wife, fabricate cosplay armor, painting, photography excursions, we even dabbled in Special Effects Makeup. She was all about DIY stuff, crafting, and creating all kinds of things. But, we set all of that aside to achieve this goal.</p>

  	    	<p>I have found myself CRAVING an opportunity to draw. But, by the time I finish my schedule for the day, I’m just kinda wiped out. Coding can be tedious, slamming your head against a wall for hours trying to fix a bug only to realize it was your indentation or you put a return statement in the wrong place. It can be mentally taxing. Finding artistic inspiration when your brain is fried is not easy.</p>

  	    	<p>So, I think I might add something to my schedule in the coming weeks. Setting aside time to enjoy the other things that I love. To spend more time with my wife doing the things that we used to do before we put our blinders on.</p>

  	    	<p>I’m also going to be updating my About Me page. I want to create some additional pages to house some of my other artistic ventures. A page dedicated to paintings and drawings I have laying around. A page dedicated to SFX makeup my wife and I have done together. A page set up for the comic strips we wrote and illustrated. And, I want to put a page together for my photography.</p>

  	    	<p>We are so close to achieving every aspect of the goal we set for ourselves. It is time to step out of that bubble and start enjoying life again.</p>

  	    	<p>How about you? What goals do you have for yourself? What are you currently working on? Have you set yourself up for success? What do you need to do to reach those goals? If we can get ourselves this far, so can you. </p>

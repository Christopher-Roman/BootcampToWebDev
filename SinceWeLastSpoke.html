        	<span class="meta">Posted by <a href="https://github.com/Christopher-Roman" target="_blank">Chris Roman</a> on February 21, 2019</span>
  	    	<p>How’re things going? How’s that schedule treating you? You doing what you said you’d be doing? You keeping up with things? What’s with the inquisition?!</p>

          <p>How’re things going? How’s that schedule treating you? You doing what you said you’d be doing? You keeping up with things? What’s with the inquisition?!</p>

          <p>JK.</p>

          <h3>How’re Things Going?</h3>

          <p>Things have been going really well. I have been getting up earlier than I had been since graduation. Between 8AM and 9AM instead of 12PM to 1PM… which means I’ve also been going to bed earlier because you know… sleep is important. </p>

  	    	<h3>How’s That Schedule Treating You?</h3>

  	    	<p>Freakin’ fantastically! Having a specific plan for each day has been INCREDIBLE. I know what I’m supposed to be working, I have pre-planned things to do each day. And, best of all, I have tangible targets to hit. Which is incentive!
          </p>

          <h3>You Doing What You Said You’d Be Doing?</h3>

  	    	<p>Yes! I have been following my schedule. I did, however, move some of the scheduled stuff I had for Wednesday to Sunday due to a personal situation. Allowing myself that flexibility (every now and again, I don’t want to get into a habit of it!) takes a lot of the stress out of things.</p>

  	    	<h3>You Keeping Up With Things?</h3>

  	    	<p>I have been! Day one (Monday), I followed my schedule to the letter. Day two was an interview day, so hitting the Job Search number was easy! Also, Codewars is awesome! And, Swift is going to be a lot of fun! Day three went pretty well. I hit a hiccup due to a personal situation I mentioned earlier, but that is what my weekend work is going to cover. Today is day four. I woke up this morning at 9AM, did some Codewars, started working on this blog post, and then got back into some project work. After that, I have two Swift lectures with my name on them!</p>

          <h3>What’s With the Inquisition?!</h3>

  	    	<p>It’s exactly what I need to keep myself pushing forward! Accountability is key!</p>

          <h3>Next Steps?</h3>

  	    	<p>Continue doing what I’m doing! I have a Technical Interview and a Soft Skills Interview coming up on Monday. I am BEYOND excited, and still mostly terrified about the Technical interview. But, Codewars is going to help me gain some confidence. I also reached out to the Global Instructor from my Bootcamp and he gave me some ideas on things to study before the interview. Can’t thank you enough Jim!</p>

          <h3>Final Thoughts</h3>

  	    	<p>I’m feeling really good about this plan. It sets up attainable daily goals that add up to complete long term goals. If you are using the spreadsheet I put together or you just want to chat about finding motivation (or, even better, what you do to get motivated), feel free to hit me up on my social media. The links are at the bottom of the page.</p>

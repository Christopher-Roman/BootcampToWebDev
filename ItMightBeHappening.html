        	<h1>It Might Be Happening</h1>
        	<span class="meta">Posted by <a href="https://github.com/Christopher-Roman" target="_blank">Chris Roman</a> on March 3, 2019</span>

          <p>This past week I had an interview with a tech company that has been around for a little while. The role feels like it would be a really good fit for me because it will use my previous experience in customer support, which I am really excited about. The interview that I had scheduled was broken up into two parts. An observed technical interview conducted by one manager and a soft skills interview with two managers conducting it.</p>

          <p>So, how did I feel afterward? What was it like? How did I feel during it? How did I prepare before it?</p>

          <p>I am going to answer all of these questions… but in reverse order. Because you know… hooking the reader and what not... right?</p>

          <p>As it was my first technical interview with an observer, it was REALLY nerve wracking leading up to it. I had no idea what to prepare for as the company doesn’t use a specific tech stack. So, how did I prep? </p>

          <p>First, I reached out to my old instructor. I asked him how he thought I should prepare. He sent me to <a href="https://www.hackerrank.com/" target="_blank">HackerRank</a> to practice problems. I also spoke with the global instructor at General Assembly and he had some great advice as well. He told me I should be able to explain the differences between noSQL and SQL databases and be able to describe what they are in JavaScript, he also told me to be sure that I could accurately and efficiently explain MVC, and be able to model a data table. There were a couple of things that he also said that were more specific to the job based on the description.</p>

          <p>After I spoke with them, I got right to work. I started watching youtube videos to brush up on my knowledge of MVC and to find keywords that were often used to describe noSQL and SQL databases. I started working on HackerRank and continued my work on Codewars.</p>

          <p>Then the time finally came. I had been prepping for days. Constantly worrying if I would be able to answer the question. I was terrified that I would freeze up. That my mind would shit the bed and I would ruin any hope of getting this job.</p>

          <p>The interview turned out to be a lot less intense than I was expecting. The interviewer had me walk him through how I would handle helping someone figure out how to do a GET request from their API that would return specific information. We went over their docs together and I told him how I was figuring out what we would need to do to achieve the goal. I talked him through my thought process and I was able to reach the answer before my time ran out. </p>

          <p>Could I have done it more efficiently? Could I have figured it out faster. Probably. But, I did it. I figured it out. And, he congratulated me for it. </p>

          <p>The thing I was most scared of was over and I had made it through (mostly) unskathed.</p>

          <p>My next interview was for soft skills. Coming from hospitality, my soft skills are pretty sharp. I am also fortunate enough to have had so much experience in hospitality that was transferrable to this particular position. The management team asked me STAR (Situation/Task, Action, Result) questions. On top of all of that, I used to interview people all the time. And, the companies that I worked for all used the STAR Method.</p>

          <p>I felt really good about this interview. Honestly, I think I crushed this interview! It was something that I was far more familiar with and that familiarity helped to soothe my nerves. And, when those nerves aren’t around, I shine.</p>

          <p>Then it was over. And the waiting started. And the anxiety continued to build. The wife and I had plans to meet up with some friends that night for trivia and I couldn’t shake that anxious feeling the entire day.</p>

          <p>It just built up more and more and more. Tightness in my chest. Shortness of breath. Nausea. Trembling. Feeling of detachment. I’m thirty-three years old. I’ve never felt like this in my life. I’ve worked through intense situations in my previous jobs up to and including being physically assaulted by a guest while on the clock and I finished my shift! I’ve seen some shit after ten years of working the front lines of hotels.</p>

          <p>While we were on our way to trivia that night I asked my wife what an anxiety attack felt like. She listed all of the symptoms that I was feeling and I told her I was pretty sure that I was having one. She asked if I wanted to cancel the plans we had, but we had been planning this for two weeks, there was no way that I’d do that.</p>

          <p>We got to the bar, I started drinking right away, but it didn’t help. I tried focusing on the trivia. That didn’t help either. Tried holding conversations with our friends. No help. I grabbed my wife’s hand and seriously considered asking how she felt about leaving early… until I felt some relief. Holding her hand helped me. It has been the only thing that has helped me. I’m still carrying these anxious feelings every day while I wait to hear back from this company. I’m not sleeping well, I can’t focus, and my stomach has been in knots. </p>

          <p>You’re probably like, “Dude, it’s just a job…”</p>

          <p>But, it isn’t. Not only does this company have awesome tech, great benefits, and a sincere interest in ensuring that its associates succeed, it is also the final step to prove that we made the right choice. It is the thing that validates all of the sacrifices that my wife and I have made to get this far. It is the means for my wife and I to continue surviving. So much of our future rests on me getting a job that will provide for us and now that it is within reach. Now that it is an e-mail away… the thought of getting a “Thanks but no thanks” e-mail is weighing more heavily on me than anything ever has in my life.</p>

          <p>So what am I gonna do? How am I gonna get through this crushing anxiety?</p>

          <p>The job search continues tomorrow. I can’t put all my eggs in one basket.</p>
